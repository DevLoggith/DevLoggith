## Hi there, I'm Logan ðŸ‘‹
I'm a software engineer that loves creating soultions that make my ideas come to life, contriubtuing to open source projects, and collaborating with others to build solutions I could never build on my own.

I have a backgorund in front-end development using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, but have recently started learing server-side technologies like Python, Flask, and SQLite.
